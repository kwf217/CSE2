//This program should:
//use a random number generator to simulate a personâ€™s betting on 100 spins
//run the simulation 1000 times and collect data on the outcome
//compute the number of times you lose everything, the total winnings, and compute the number of times I walked away with a profit in one session of 100 spins of the wheel
